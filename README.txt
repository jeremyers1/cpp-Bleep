Note: After struggling with this project for a couple hours, I finally searched for the answer on Google. 

The "Official" Codecademy answer is found here: 
https://github.com/Codecademy/learn-cpp/tree/master/8-references-and-pointers/bleep 

But the Official Answer included lines of code that we haven't learned yet, which led to some other students writing forum posts about it. Here is one:
https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/can-someone-explain-what-is-happening-in-the-bleep-c-for-loop/480334 

Ironically, the moderators of the forum stated that the code in the Offical answer is completely wrong. It works, but it's wrong. 

People on StackOverflow say the same thing:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62604536/visualstudios-throws-exception-while-codeblocks-does-not-c

I finally found some code that works from McNulty72 on GitHub. Here is the link to his repository:
https://github.com/McNulty72/Codecademy-Bleep_project

My goal is to modify and refine this code further because it still has problems. It won't properly censor "Broccoli" or remove words that end in punctuation (broccoli, or broccoli!)

It appears that this user found a way to fix some of these problems, and I will look at the code and learn from it as well.
